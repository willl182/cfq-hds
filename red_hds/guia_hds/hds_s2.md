### Technical Guide: Mastering GHS Hazard Identification in Safety Data Sheets (Section 2\)

##### 1\. The Strategic Foundation of Hazard Communication

Section 2 of a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) serves as the "regulatory heart" and the first line of defense in chemical safety management. Far from being a mere administrative list, it acts as a strategic bridge that converts complex toxicological and physicochemical datasets into actionable safety protocols for industrial users. This section dictates the legal requirements for every subsequent section of the document, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) selection, emergency response, and storage protocols.Under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)—known as the  *Sistema Globalmente Armonizado*  (SGA)—standardized communication is mandatory. In Mexico, this is governed by  **NOM-018-STPS-2015** , while the European context relies on the  **CLP (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008)**  and  **REACH**  frameworks. Notably, documents like the Epigrip C251 SDS may exhibit a duality, referencing both the old Directive 1999/45/CE (R-phrases) and the current CLP/GHS (H-statements). This exists due to regulatory transitional periods, yet compliance officers must prioritize the CLP/GHS classification as the authoritative standard. The primary objectives of GHS implementation are:

* **Protecting Human Health and the Environment:**  Providing standardized, reliable data to prevent exposure and ecological damage.  
* **Removing Technical Barriers to Trade:**  Facilitating international chemical logistics through a common language.  
* **Standardizing Risk Communication:**  Ensuring symbols and phrases have identical meanings across all jurisdictions.  
* **Workplace Prevention:**  Enabling employers to develop robust risk assessments and training programs.These objectives are achieved through a rigorous technical framework that categorizes substances based on their intrinsic properties.

##### 2\. The GHS Classification Framework: Physical, Health, and Environmental Hazards

Precise classification is the cornerstone of workplace safety; misclassification represents a systemic failure that can lead to catastrophic accidents, such as the improper storage of incompatible materials or the use of inadequate respiratory protection.

###### *2.1 Physical Hazards*

Physical hazards are determined by the physicochemical properties of the substance.

* **Flammable Liquids:**  Severity is dictated by flash points. For instance,  **Ethylbenzene**  is a Category 2 Flammable Liquid (H225), whereas  **Xylene**  is a Category 3 (H226).  
* **Corrosive to Metals:**  Substances that can damage or destroy metal containers through chemical action.

###### *2.2 Health Hazards*

Health hazard criteria evaluate the potential physiological impact on the user.

* **Acute Toxicity:**  Measured by LD50/LC50 values.  **Benzyl Alcohol** , for example, is classified as Category 4 for oral and inhalation toxicity (H302/H332).  
* **Skin Corrosion/Irritation:**  Severity ranges from irritation to irreversible tissue damage. The  **Amino Polymer (CAS: 135108-88-2)**  in Epigrip C251 is the primary driver for  **Skin Corrosion Category 1B (H314)** .  
* **Sensitization and Chronic Effects:**  Includes substances like  **4,4'-metilenbis(ciclohexilamina)** , which triggers Skin Sensitization (H317) and  **Specific Target Organ Toxicity \- Repeated Exposure (STOT RE 2, H373)** .

###### *2.3 Environmental Hazards*

Categorized by the threat to the biosphere, specifically aquatic life.

* **Aquatic Toxicity:**  Divided into Acute and Chronic categories (H400–H412). Epigrip components such as 4,4'-metilenbis contribute to Chronic Category 2 or 3 designations.

###### *Hazard Class vs. Category Levels*

The following table demonstrates how severity dictates classification levels and their corresponding H-codes:| Hazard Class | Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Category 4 || \------ | \------ | \------ | \------ | \------ || **Flammable Liquid** | Extremely Flam. (H224) | Highly Flam. (H225) | Flammable (H226) | N/A || **Acute Toxicity** | Fatal (H300/H330) | Fatal (H300/H330) | Toxic (H301/H331) | Harmful (H302/H332) || **Skin Corrosion** | Cat 1: Corrosive (H314) | Cat 2: Irritant (H315) | Cat 3: Mild Irrit. (H316) | N/A || **Aquatic Chronic** | Very Toxic (H410) | Toxic (H411) | Harmful (H412) | Long-term (H413) |

##### 3\. Essential Labeling Elements: Pictograms, Signal Words, and Safety Phrases

The semiotics of hazard communication ensures immediate risk recognition in high-stress emergency scenarios. Harmonized visual and textual triggers allow users to understand risks regardless of linguistic barriers.

###### *Pictogram Selection and Precedence*

Safety specialists must adhere to strict selection rules for the GHS01–GHS09 symbols. For the Epigrip C251 mixture, the presence of flammable and corrosive ingredients mandates the use of  **GHS02 (Flame)**  and  **GHS05 (Corrosion)** .**Critical Hierarchy Rule:**  If the  **GHS05 (Corrosion)**  pictogram is assigned for skin or eye damage, the  **GHS07 (Exclamation Mark)**  pictogram for skin or eye irritation is prohibited for that specific substance or mixture to avoid redundant or confusing signaling.

###### *Signal Words: Peligro (Danger) vs. Atención (Warning)*

* **Danger (**  ***Peligro***  **):**  Reserved for the most severe categories (e.g., Category 1 and 2).  
* **Warning (**  ***Atención***  **):**  Used for lower-severity hazards.The signal word for a mixture is determined by its most severe component. Epigrip C251 uses  **Danger**  because the Category 1 Health Hazards (Skin Corrosion) override the lower-severity physical or health categories of other ingredients.

##### 4\. Decoding Hazard (H) and Precautionary (P) Statements

The alphanumeric coding system facilitates global data management by providing a standardized language for chemical logistics.

* **H-Statements (H200–H499):**  Standardized descriptions of hazards (e.g., H314: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage).  
* **EUH Phrases:**  In CLP regions, safety professionals must include  **Supplemental Hazard Information**  (EUH phrases) for risks not covered by the global GHS H-codes.  
* **P-Statements (P100–P500):**  Divided into Prevention (P200s), Response (P300s), Storage (P400s), and Disposal (P500s).**Mandatory Response Protocol:**  In the event of inhalation, the exact standardized response protocol for a corrosive/toxic mixture as per the source is:  **P304 \+ P340 \+ P310**  (IF INHALED: Remove person to fresh air and keep comfortable for breathing. Immediately call a POISON CENTER or doctor).Per regulatory mandates, the  **full text**  of these phrases must be displayed in Section 16 of the SDS to eliminate ambiguity.

##### 5\. Documentation of Other Hazards and Significant Non-Classified Risks

Comprehensive risk assessment requires identifying "hidden" risks—substances of high concern that may not meet GHS classification thresholds but still pose significant threats.

###### *Identifying Non-Classified Hazards (Section 2.3)*

This section must document risks such as dust explosions, mechanical asphyxiation, or the presence of  **Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)** . If no such hazards exist, the SDS must explicitly state: "No se conoce ninguno" (None known).

###### *Decision Algorithm for Significant Risks*

1. **Check for SVHC Status:**  Is the substance listed as an Endocrine Disruptor, PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative, Toxic), or vPvB (very Persistent, very Bioaccumulative)?  
2. **Evaluate Physical Interaction:**  Does the substance pose a risk of oxygen depletion in confined spaces?  
3. **Assess Dust Explosion Potential:**  Does the material form explosive dust-air mixtures during processing?  
4. **Confirm Absence:**  If none of the above are met, record the explicit "None known" regulatory entry.

##### 6\. Technical Reference: Decision Logic and Classification Examples

Regulatory consistency requires benchmarking against established chemical classifications.

###### *Quick Reference Classification Table*

Chemical Identity,CAS / Identifier,GHS Classification,Pictograms,Signal Word

Xylene,1330-20-7,Flam. Liq. 3 (H226); Acute Tox. 4 (H312/332); Skin Irrit. 2 (H315),"GHS02, GHS07",Danger

Benzyl Alcohol,100-51-6,Acute Tox. 4 (Oral H302 / Inhal H332),GHS07,Warning

"4,4'-metilenbis",1761-71-3,Skin Corr. 1A (H314); Skin Sens. 1 (H317); STOT RE 2 (H373); Aquatic Chronic 2 (H411),"GHS05, GHS07, GHS09",Danger

Epigrip Additive,Mixture,Flam. Liq. 3; Acute Tox. 4; Skin Corr. 1B; Skin Sens. 1; Aquatic Chronic 3,"GHS02, GHS05",Danger

###### *Technical Warnings*

* **Hierarchy of Labeling:**  Ensure GHS05 takes precedence over GHS07 for irritation.  
* **Incompatibility Checks:**  Verify that the corrosivity and flammability identified in Section 2 are reflected in the storage requirements of Section 7 (e.g., separation from strong acids/bases).

##### 7\. Integration and Compliance: The SDS as a Living Safety Tool

Section 2 is the data engine that drives the entire SDS. The classifications here trigger the necessity for an  **Extended SDS (e-SDS)**  and the inclusion of  **Exposure Scenarios (EE)**  in the Annex. These scenarios provide specific operational conditions and risk management measures for identified uses.

###### *Employer and Compliance Obligations*

Under  **NOM-018-STPS-2015** , employers must maintain a complete list of hazardous substances including their  **Número CAS** . Per  **NTP 1198** , employers must ensure:

* **Accessibility:**  SDS must be available to workers throughout their shift.  
* **Consistency:**  Information in Section 2 must perfectly match the physical container labels.  
* **Training:**  Workers must be trained to recognize pictograms and signal words instantly.As a living tool, the SDS must be updated immediately upon receipt of new toxicological data or legislative changes to REACH Annex II or NOM-018, ensuring the first line of defense remains impenetrable.
