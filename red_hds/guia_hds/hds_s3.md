### Technical Guide for SDS Section 3: Composition and Component Information

##### 1\. Strategic Importance of the Compositional Profile

Section 3 is the architectural foundation of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). It establishes the precise chemical profile that dictates every downstream safety intervention, from the toxicological assessments in Section 11 to the Exposure Controls in Section 8\. For the  **Usuario Intermedio**  (Downstream User), this section is the primary data source for the mandatory chemical risk assessment (CRA). Under the current regulatory landscape, specifically  **Commission Regulation (EU) 2020/878**  and  **NOM-018-STPS-2015** , Section 3 acts as the critical bridge: it transforms raw compositional data into actionable hazard identification.Compliance failure in Section 3 documentation triggers a cascade of liability. An omitted component or an inaccurate concentration range renders the industrial safety protocols technically void and exposes the enterprise to severe regulatory sanctions. Accuracy here ensures the "Integrated Management System" of a professional enterprise functions with total transparency, providing the "right to know" for workers and the technical precision required by emergency responders.This guide outlines the rigorous protocols necessary for ensuring absolute traceability and compliance for substances and mixtures.

##### 2\. Protocol for Pure Substances: Absolute Chemical Identity

For mono-constituent substances, unequivocal identification is non-negotiable to ensure traceability across global databases and compliance with the registration requirements of REACH. The objective is to eliminate ambiguity that could lead to the application of incorrect toxicological data.As per  **Regulation (EU) 2020/878** , the following identifiers must be meticulously documented:

* **IUPAC Nomenclature:**  The formal systematic name providing a unique structural description.  
* **Trade Names:**  All commercial designations used for market identification.  
* **Molecular and Structural Formulas:**  Precise chemical notation defining elemental composition and atomic arrangement.  
* **Registry Numbers:**  CAS (Chemical Abstract Service), CE/EINECS (European Commission), and Index numbers must be verified against official repositories.**Reporting Thresholds:**  In addition to the primary substance, the specialist must report impurities, isomers, and stabilizing additives that influence the hazard profile. The mandatory cut-off limits are:  
* **0.1%**  for substances contributing to the hazard classification (e.g., mutagens, carcinogens).  
* **1.0%**  for non-hazardous impurities or additives.A rigorous Section 3 for pure substances provides the "chemical DNA" required for the subsequent identification of hazards in Section 2\.

##### 3\. Classification and Documentation of Mixtures

Documenting mixtures requires a shift from intrinsic substance properties to the  **"Conventional Method."**  This refers to the calculation-based method (as established in Directive 1999/45/CE and transitioned to CLP/GHS) for determining mixture hazards by evaluating the concentrations and specific hazards of individual constituents rather than testing the mixture as a whole.**Inclusion Criteria for Components:**  Under both REACH/CLP and Mexican NOM-018-STPS-2015, components must be disclosed if they meet the following:

* **Hazard-Based Thresholds:**  Presence at or above cut-off limits defined for physical, health, or environmental hazards.  
* **Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs):**  Substances with specific regulated limits (e.g., Xylene, Ethylbenzene) must be disclosed regardless of concentration, as they trigger mandatory monitoring in Section 8\.  
* **PBT/vPvB Substances:**  Components classified as Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic, or very Persistent and very Bioaccumulative, are subject to mandatory disclosure.  
* **Mexican NOM-018-STPS-2015 Specifics:**  The list must explicitly include the hazard identification according to GHS categories for each hazardous chemical.**Standardized Table Template with "Tipo" Classification:**  Modern compliance requires the use of the "Tipo" (Type) identifier to explain  *why*  a substance is listed.| Chemical Name/Identifier | CAS Number | Concentration/Range | Hazard Classification (H-phrases) | Tipo || \------ | \------ | \------ | \------ | \------ || **Component A** | XXXX-XX-X | \>35 \- \<50% | H302, H314, H318 | 1 || **Component B** | XXXX-XX-X | 10 \- 20% | H226, H312, H332, H315 | 1 2 |

**Legend for "Tipo":**  1 Substance classified with a health or environmental hazard. 2 Substance with professional exposure limits. 3 Substance meets PBT criteria (Regulation (CE) 1907/2006, Annex XIII). 4 Substance meets vPvB (mPmB) criteria. 5 Substance of equivalent concern.

##### 4\. Framework for Confidential Business Information (CBI)

The architecture of the SDS allows for the protection of proprietary formulations through the management of Confidential Business Information (CBI), balancing trade secrets with the safety rights of the workforce.**Legal Parameters and the "Safety Override":**

* **Trade Secret Invocation:**  Valid only if the chemical identity is not public and disclosure would cause demonstrable commercial harm. This typically requires a formal notification process to competent authorities.  
* **The Safety Override:**  Confidentiality is never absolute. In emergency medical situations or direct threats to life, the full chemical identity must be disclosed to medical professionals immediately.  
* **Generic Name Compliance:**  When using a generic name (e.g., "Amino Polymer"), it must be descriptive enough to allow the Downstream User to implement the precise risk management measures and exposure controls defined in Section 8\.

##### 5\. Verification Standards and Official Databases

To prevent "cascading errors," specialists must cross-reference supplier data with authoritative repositories. Furthermore, Section 3 serves as the primary trigger for the  **Extended SDS (FDS Ampliada)** .**The e-FDS Connection:**  Under REACH Article 14.4, if a substance is registered at  **\>10 tonnes/year**  and is classified as hazardous, an  **Exposure Scenario (ES)**  must be attached as an annex. The specialist must verify that the identified uses (Section 1.2) are covered by the ES derived from the components listed in Section 3\. Failure to align these rendered the safety management of the substance non-compliant.**Authoritative Databases:**

* **ECHA (European Chemicals Agency):**  The gold standard for REACH/CLP registered substances and harmonized classifications.  
* **ESIS (European Chemical Substances Information System):**  For legacy identification and historical registry data.  
* **ChemIDplus:**  Essential for toxicological data and multi-registry verification.

##### 6\. Practical Application: Presentation Examples

Visual clarity is vital for rapid response. Using data from the  **Epigrip C251 Phenolic Epoxy Primer/Finish** , the following examples demonstrate professional-grade presentation.

###### *Example 1: Pure Substance (Solvent Component)*

* **Chemical Name:**  Benzyl Alcohol  
* **CAS Number:**  100-51-6  
* **CE Number:**  202-859-9  
* **Hazard Classification:**  Acute Tox. 4, H302; Acute Tox. 4, H332.

###### *Example 2: Simple Mixture (Solvent Blend)*

* **Xylene (CAS 1330-20-7):**  \>=12.5 \- \<20%. Hazards: H226, H312, H332, H315. Tipo 1, 2

###### *Final Compliance Checklist*

*   **e-FDS Trigger:**  Do components registered at \>10t/y have attached Exposure Scenarios?  
*   **OEL Alignment:**  Are all components with exposure limits (e.g., Ethylbenzene, Xylene) correctly mapped to the monitoring requirements in Section 8?  
*   **H-Phrase Integrity:**  Do Section 3 classifications (e.g., H318, H373) perfectly match the Section 2 hazard declaration?  
*   **NOM-018-STPS-2015:**  Does the listing include the specific GHS hazard categories for the Mexican market?

##### Conclusion

Section 3 is far more than a simple ingredient list; it is the technical blueprint for the safe handling of chemicals. By ensuring the precise identification of components and their associated "Tipo" classifications, an enterprise secures its regulatory standing and provides the necessary clarity for the  **FDS Ampliada** , protecting both the workforce and the environment.
