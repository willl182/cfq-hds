### Technical Guide to Section 14: Transport Information for Dangerous Goods

##### 1\. Strategic Foundation of Transport Compliance

Section 14 of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) serves as the definitive legal bridge between chemical manufacturing and global logistics. While earlier sections of the SDS focus on GHS (Globally Harmonized System) workplace safety, Section 14 translates these hazards into the language of transport regulations. Its strategic importance cannot be overstated: it is the primary instrument ensuring the safety of transport workers and emergency responders while maintaining the integrity of the global supply chain. This section synthesizes international standards from the UN "Orange Book" and regional mandates such as the European REACH/CLP frameworks and Mexico’s  **NOM-004-SCT/2000** . Critically, Section 14 is the only part of the document where the commercial product name is legally superseded by the  **Proper Shipping Name (PSN)** , marking the shift from chemical identification to hazard-based logistical classification.

##### 2\. Primary Identification: The UN Number and Proper Shipping Name (PSN)

The cornerstone of dangerous goods logistics is the precise identification of the substance. For a Senior Regulatory Specialist, this is not a matter of choice but a rigorous methodology.

* **Methodology for Identification:**  The UN Number—a four-digit identifier preceded by "UN" or "ONU"—is determined by consulting the  **Dangerous Goods List**  found in Chapter 3.2 of the UN Model Regulations (and mirrored in the ADR/IMDG codes). Logistics experts cross-reference the numerical list (for known UN numbers) or the alphabetical list (when only a name is known) to find the entry that best fits the chemical's properties.  
* **The Case of Epigrip C251:**  While the product is marketed as "Epigrip C251 Phenolic Epoxy Primer/Finish," its transport identity is  **UN1263** .  
* **Proper Shipping Name (PSN):**  For UN1263, the PSN is  **PAINT RELATED MATERIAL** .**The "So What?" Layer:**  In international commerce, the PSN ensures linguistic precision across borders. While specific products require a "Technical Name" in parentheses for "N.O.S." (Not Otherwise Specified) designations to inform emergency responders of the precise hazard, standard entries like UN1263 provide an immediate, functional category. This categorization dictates the emergency response protocols (EmS) that a carrier will follow in the event of an incident.

##### 3\. Hazard Classification: Classes, Divisions, and Subsidiaries

The UN classification system categorizes substances into nine classes based on the primary risk they pose during transit.**The 9 Hazard Classes:**

1. **Class 1:**  Explosives (Divisions 1.1–1.6)  
2. **Class 2:**  Gases (2.1 Flammable, 2.2 Non-flammable/non-toxic, 2.3 Toxic)  
3. **Class 3:**  Flammable Liquids (e.g.,  **Epigrip C251** )  
4. **Class 4:**  Flammable Solids (4.1 Solids, 4.2 Spontaneous combustion, 4.3 Dangerous when wet)  
5. **Class 5:**  Oxidizing Substances and Organic Peroxides  
6. **Class 6:**  Toxic and Infectious Substances  
7. **Class 8:**  Corrosive Substances  
8. **Class 9:**  Miscellaneous Dangerous Goods**Strategic Distinction (GHS vs. Transport):**  A common pitfall is assuming that GHS hazards in Section 2 automatically dictate Transport Classes in Section 14\. For example,  *Epigrip C251*  contains components like Amino Polymer which trigger a GHS classification of  **H314 (Skin Corr. 1B)**  in Section 2\. However, according to the source context, its Transport Classification remains strictly  **Class 3** . Unlike workplace safety, transport regulations only require a "Subsidiary Risk" (e.g., Class 8\) if the substance meets specific criteria defined in the Dangerous Goods List. For  *Epigrip* , the flammability is the only regulated risk for transport; thus, no Class 8 subsidiary label or vehicle placard is required.

##### 4\. Degree of Danger: The Packing Group System

The Packing Group (PG) system evaluates the severity of the hazard to determine the structural integrity required for containment.

* **Group I (High Danger):**  Highest specification packaging.  
* **Group II (Medium Danger):**  Standard dangerous goods packaging.  
* **Group III (Low Danger):**  Packaging for substances with a minor degree of danger.**Logistical Impact:**   *Epigrip C251*  is assigned to  **Packing Group III** . For the shipper, this is a strategic advantage. PG III substances offer greater cost-efficiency, as they allow for more flexible logistics options and higher volume thresholds for  **Limited Quantity (LQ)**  exemptions compared to PG II materials.

##### 5\. Environmental Hazard Assessment

Transport regulations distinguish between general toxicity and hazards specifically regulated for maritime transit under the IMDG Code.

* **Marine Pollutants:**  These are substances toxic to aquatic life that require the "Fish and Tree" mark.  
* **Case Study Evaluation:**  Although  *Epigrip C251*  is classified in Section 12 as harmful to aquatic organisms (H411/H412), Section 14 explicitly identifies it as  **"No" for Environmental Hazards**  (Peligros para el medio ambiente: No).  
* **The "So What?" Layer:**  Because it does not meet the specific transport criteria for a Marine Pollutant, the "Fish and Tree" symbol is  *not*  required on packages or transport units. This highlight illustrates the legal separation between ecological hazard warnings (GHS) and mandatory transport markings (DG).

##### 6\. Special Precautions and User Restrictions

Special precautions provide a risk-mitigation toolkit for the carrier, impacting route planning and operational costs.

* **Limited Quantities (LQ) and Excepted Quantities (EQ):**  These allow for the transport of dangerous goods in small, robustly packed units with reduced regulatory oversight. For a senior expert, maximizing the use of LQ and EQ is a primary strategy for reducing logistics overhead.  
* **Tunnel Restriction Codes:**  For road transport (ADR),  *Epigrip*  is assigned code  **D/E** . This restricts the vehicle from entering certain tunnels when the load exceeds specific thresholds, necessitating strategic route planning to avoid delays.  
* **Emergency Schedules (EmS):**   *Epigrip*  requires  **F-E**  (Fire schedule) and  **S-E**  (Spillage schedule). These codes dictate the exact tools and procedures used by maritime crews in an emergency.  
* **Training Mandate:**  All personnel involved in the movement of these goods—including those loading and unloading—must be trained on the specific risks (fire, inhalation, and corrosivity) and the required PPE as emphasized in the source data.

##### 7\. Multimodal Regulatory Frameworks and Regional Variations

Navigating global logistics requires compliance with overlapping and sometimes conflicting regulatory bodies.| Regulatory Body | Mode of Transport | Geographic/Legal Scope || \------ | \------ | \------ || **ADR** | Land / Road | Europe and participating nations || **49 CFR** | Land / Road & Rail | United States of America || **NOM-004-SCT/2000** | Land / Road & Rail | Mexico (Transport-specific standard) || **IMDG** | Sea / Maritime | International waters (Global) || **IATA** | Air | Global aviation || **ADN** | Fluvial / Inland Waterways | International rivers and canals |

**The Expert View:**  A specialist must realize that a product may be permissible for ground transport under  **ADR**  or  **NOM-004**  but could be strictly forbidden or highly restricted for air travel under  **IATA**  due to atmospheric pressure changes.

##### 8\. Documentation, Labeling, and Physical Identification

The "Paper Trail" and visual signaling constitute the primary defense against mishandling and legal liability.

* **Documentation:**  Every shipment must include a  **Shipper’s Declaration**  or a  **Bill of Lading** . In Mexico, the  **Carta de Porte**  is the mandatory document that must list the UN Number, PSN, Class, and Packing Group to ensure compliance with  **NOM-004-SCT** .  
* **Labeling:**  Individual packages must display the Class 3 red flammable liquid diamond (minimum  **100x100 mm** ).  
* **Placarding:**  While labels are for packages,  **placards**  are the larger hazard signals placed on the exterior of the transport unit (trucks, ISO-tanks, or containers). For  *Epigrip* , only the Class 3 flammable placard is required.

##### 9\. Exemptions, Small Quantities, and Emergency Protocols

Strategic logistics requires a balance between safety and practical commercial movement.

* **Small Quantity Exceptions:**  Classification exceptions often apply to consumer goods (cosmetics, medicines), but industrial additives like  *Epigrip*  rarely qualify for these outside of specific LQ/EQ provisions.  
* **Emergency Protocol Linkage:**  In the event of an incident, the  **EmS codes (F-E, S-E)**  are the primary reference. Personnel must utilize the PPE specified in Section 8 (Organic vapor respirators, nitrile or butyl gloves) and follow the accidental release measures in Section 6, such as avoiding all ignition sources and preventing entry into waterways.  
* **The "Shipper of Record" Liability:**  As a final directive, the legal responsibility for the suitability of the packaging and the accuracy of the classification rests solely with the  **Shipper of Record** . Failure to correctly identify a substance or provide the correct UN-standard packaging can result in severe legal penalties, supply chain seizures, and unmitigated liability in the event of an accident.
