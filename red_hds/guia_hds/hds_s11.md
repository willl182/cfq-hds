### Technical Guide for the Authoring and Interpretation of SDS Section 11: Toxicological Information

#### 1\. Introduction to Toxicological Reporting Standards

Section 11 represents the technical and legal backbone of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). For a Senior Toxicologist, this section is not merely a list of studies; it is the scientific justification for hazard classifications in Section 2, the selection of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in Section 8, and the establishment of safe handling limits. Compliance with the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), European  **CLP (Regulation CE nº 1272/2008)** , and Mexican  **NOM-018-STPS-2015**  requires that Section 11 provides a clear, defensible evidence base for the mixture’s hazards.

1. **Scope and Purpose:**  Toxicological data serves as a hazard identification tool for health and safety professionals and a risk-communication resource for workers. It bridges the gap between raw data (LD50) and operational safety (Required Engineering Controls).  
2. **Regulatory Foundation:**  Authors must adhere to the structural requirements of  **REACH (Regulation CE nº 1907/2006)**  and regional standards like  **NOM-018-STPS-2015**  to ensure legal validity during workplace audits and supply chain transitions.  
3. **Strategic Data Integrity:**  The author must employ "Absolute Grounding" by using verified chemical reference points such as  **Benzyl Alcohol**  and  **Xylene** . Grounding the hazard profile in these known entities prevents legal and financial liability associated with over-classification (unnecessary costs) or under-classification (occupational health risks).

#### 2\. Pathways of Human Exposure

Identifying exposure routes is a strategic necessity for implementing Engineering Controls. A precise description of entry points allows the specialist to justify the necessity of specific PPE.

1. **Inhalation Dynamics:**  When reporting on solvent-heavy mixtures, use technical phrasing to describe entry: "Vapors reach the Central Nervous System (CNS) via the alveolar-capillary membrane." Exposure to vapors, mists, or dusts above professional limits causes mucous membrane irritation and systemic effects.  
2. **Ingestion Risks:**  Accidental ingestion must be reported with attention to clinical symptoms. Source data for phenolic epoxy additives specifies symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.  
3. **Dermal and Ocular Contact:**  Distinguish between absorption through intact vs. damaged skin. Solvents exhibit lipophilicity, dissolving the skin’s lipid bilayer and leading to non-allergic contact dermatitis. Ocular contact can range from reversible irritation to permanent tissue damage.  
4. **Exposure Pathway Table:**| Route | Physical State | Target Organs | Typical Clinical Symptoms || \------ | \------ | \------ | \------ || **Inhalation** | Vapors / Mists | Respiratory Tract, CNS, Kidneys, Liver | Headache, dizziness, fatigue, muscular weakness, drowsiness. || **Ingestion** | Liquid / Mist | Gastrointestinal Tract, CNS | Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, potential loss of consciousness. || **Dermal** | Liquid / Mist | Skin, Systemic (via absorption) | Dermatitis (lipid removal), redness, systemic toxicity. || **Ocular** | Liquid / Splash | Eyes (Cornea/Conjunctiva) | Irritation, redness, reversible lesions, or permanent impairment. |

#### 3\. Quantitative Acute Toxicity and GHS Classification

Quantitative metrics (LD50/LC50) are the "So What?" layer of immediate safety, determining the severity of handling precautions.

* **Quantitative Metrics:**  
* **Oral LD50:**  Report in mg/kg (e.g.,  **Benzyl Alcohol** : 1230 mg/kg, Rat).  
* **Dermal LD50:**  Report in mg/kg (e.g.,  **Xylene** : 4300 mg/kg, Rat).  
* **Inhalation LC50:**  Report in mg/L or ppm. Ensure normalization to a  **4-hour exposure**  (e.g.,  **Xylene** : 5000 ppm for 4 hours).  
* **Species Specification:**  Authors must specify the animal model (Rat/Rabbit).  
* **Acute Toxicity Estimates (ATE):**  For complex mixtures like  **Epigrip C251** , use the  **GHS Additivity Formula**  (Chapter 3.1) to derive values. Calculated ATEs for this mixture are:  
* **Oral:**  898.4 mg/kg.  
* **Inhalation (Vapors):**  435.4 mg/l.  
* **Inhalation (Dusts/Mists):**  3.814 mg/l.  
* **GHS Categorization:**  Assign categories based on ATE. A calculated Oral ATE of 898.4 mg/kg places a mixture in  **Category 4 (Harmful/Nocivo)** .

#### 4\. Local Tissue Effects: Corrosion and Irritation

Distinguishing between reversible (Irritation) and irreversible (Corrosion) damage is critical for emergency response.

* **Skin Corrosion vs. Irritation:**  
* **Corrosion (Cat 1A, 1B, 1C):**  Irreversible damage.  **4,4'-metilenbis(ciclohexilamina)**  is classified as  **Category 1A (Skin Corr. H314)** , causing severe burns.  
* **Irritation (Cat 2):**  Reversible damage.  **Xylene**  is a Category 2 irritant (Rabbit model: 500 mg/24 hours \- moderate).  
* **Serious Eye Damage and Ocular Irritation:**  
* **Category 1:**  Permanent impairment.  **Ethylbenzene**  (Muy irritante, 500 mg Rabbit) and  **4,4'-metilenbis**  (10 microliters Rabbit) can cause irreversible lesions.  
* **Category 2:**  Reversible effects within 21 days.  
* **Strategic Nuance:**  Category 1 damage necessitates plumbed, high-flow eyewash stations, whereas Category 2 may only require portable units.  
* **Visual Hazard Indicators:**  The author must use the  **corrosive pictogram**  (substance dripping on hand and surface) to communicate the severity of Category 1 effects visually.

#### 5\. Sensitization and Chronic Health Hazards (CMR)

CMR reporting (Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Reproductive toxicity) is vital for long-term liability management.

* **Sensitization:**  
* **Skin Sensitization:**   **4,4'-metilenbis(ciclohexilamina)**  is a confirmed sensitizer, classified as  **Skin Sens. 1 (H317)** .  
* **Germ Cell Mutagenicity:**  Requires a weight-of-evidence approach.  
* **Carcinogenicity Classifications:**  Reference IARC (Groups 1 to 3\) and NTP/OSHA (Known vs. Anticipated).  **Ethylbenzene**  requires specific monitoring due to its potential long-term profile.  
* **Reporting Data Gaps:**  When experimental data is absent, the author must use precise boilerplate.  
* **"No information available"**  indicates a true data gap.  
* **"Based on available data, the classification criteria are not met"**  should be used when the mixture has been evaluated (e.g., via the  **Conventional Method of Directive 1999/45/CE** ) and no hazard was found.

#### 6\. Systemic Toxicity (STOT) and Aspiration Hazards

Section 11 must transition from general lethality to organ-specific damage.

1. **STOT \- Single Exposure (SE):**  Focus on acute, non-lethal effects.  **Category 3**  is frequently assigned to solvents for narcotic effects (dizziness, somnolence) or respiratory tract irritation.  
2. **STOT \- Repeated Exposure (RE):**  Identify chronic target organs. Prolonged solvent exposure impacts the  **liver, kidneys, and CNS** .  **4,4'-metilenbis(ciclohexilamina)**  is classified as  **STOT RE 2 (H373)**  for risks of serious health effects through repeated ingestion.  
3. **Aspiration Hazard:**  This is a mechanical hazard determined by  **kinematic viscosity** . If the viscosity is  **\>0.07 cm²/s at 40°C**  (as seen in the Epigrip C251 physical properties), the substance must be evaluated for aspiration risk.  
4. **Mode of Action:**  Describe the mechanism when known. For example: "Solvent-induced dermatitis occurs via the extraction of natural cutaneous fats (lipophilicity), leading to a compromised skin barrier."

#### 7\. Advanced Data Presentation and Methodology

Ensure transparency through high-fidelity reporting, even when data is sparse.

* **Handling Data Gaps:**  
* **Read-Across:**  Use data from structurally analogous chemicals.  
* **QSAR Modeling:**  Utilize Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship models for predictive toxicological profiling.  
* **Methodological Transparency:**  The author must distinguish between the  **"Conventional Method of Directive 1999/45/CE"**  and the newer  **"Calculation Method of Regulation 1272/2008 (CLP)"**  used to derive the hazard profile.  
* **Symptom Reporting Checklist:**  
* **Immediate:**  Mucous membrane irritation, nausea, dizziness.  
* **Delayed:**  Symptoms from decomposition products (e.g., nitrogen oxides in fires) may appear up to  **48 hours**  post-exposure, requiring medical surveillance.  
* **Chronic:**  CNS impairment, dermatitis, liver dysfunction.  
* **Source Referencing:**  Cite primary studies (e.g., Rabbit/Rat models) and regulatory databases like  **ECHA (EU)** ,  **INSST (Spain)** , and the  **NOM-018-STPS-2015**  framework. Proper citation ensures the SDS remains a credible legal and safety instrument.
