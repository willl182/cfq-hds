### Technical Guide: Constructing Section 1 of a GHS-Compliant Safety Data Sheet (SDS)

**1\. Strategic Importance of Section 1 in Chemical Communication**  Section 1 is the primary gateway for risk management in any hazardous chemical environment. It functions as the critical junction where the physical substance meets its legal identity and institutional accountability. For the Global Chemical Regulatory Compliance Specialist, this section is not merely an administrative requirement; it is a strategic document that ensures supply chain transparency and facilitates immediate action during a crisis. High-stakes incidents require instantaneous recognition of the material to deploy specific neutralizing agents or medical protocols. Any ambiguity in Section 1 introduces a latency period in emergency response that can lead to catastrophic environmental impact or loss of life. Consequently, the information documented here must be technically rigorous and cross-referenced with the substance’s physical labeling and workplace hazard signage.**2\. Subsection 1.1: Product Identifiers and Chemical Fingerprinting**  Precise nomenclature is the foundation of international trade and workplace safety. Without a verified chemical fingerprint, global logistics and local emergency responders cannot ensure they are handling a substance according to its specific hazard profile.**Mandatory Instructional Procedure for Identification:**  To achieve absolute compliance, follow this step-by-step methodology for assigning product identifiers:

* **Establish Nomenclature:**  For pure substances, mandate the use of the formal IUPAC or chemical name. For mixtures, use the trade designation exactly as it appears on the physical container. For example, use "Epigrip C251 Phenolic Epoxy Primer/Finish \- Additive" and its specific product code "C251A."  
* **Verify the CAS Number:**  You must document the  **Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)**  number as the primary global identifier. Conduct a mandatory cross-reference check between the components listed in Section 3 and the primary identifier in Section 1.1. Verify these against the CAS Registry or the ECHA database.  
* **Integrate Secondary Identifiers:**  To satisfy REACH and international verification requirements, you must include the  **EC numbers (EINECS/ELINCS)** . For instance, if the mixture contains Benzyl Alcohol, its identifier must be listed as CE: 202-859-9.  
* **Ensure Signage Alignment:**  Under  **NOM-018-STPS-2015** , the product name in Section 1.1 must be identical to the "Nombre de la sustancia química o mezcla" utilized in your workplace Hazard Identification System (signage).**Common Pitfalls to Audit:**  
* **Generic Descriptions:**  Using titles like "Hardener" or "Epoxy Part B" instead of the full trade name.  
* **Regulatory Mismatch:**  Failing to ensure the SDS name matches the physical container label or the internal signage required by Mexican standards.  
* **Incomplete EC/CAS Data:**  Leaving these fields blank for known hazardous components.These identifiers serve as the legal link between the SDS and the physical product, transitioning the focus from "what" the product is to "how" it is permitted to be used.**3\. Subsection 1.2: Pertinent Identified Uses and Restrictions**  Defining the "envelope of use" is the primary mechanism for mitigating legal liability and preventing hazardous misuse. In the event of an industrial accident, failing to explicitly restrict a use serves as a primary vector for litigation.**Technical Framework for Use Documentation:**  
* **Industrial Uses:**  High-volume, high-risk applications occurring in professional-controlled environments. In the source context of the Epigrip C251 additive, the use is strictly limited:  *"Sólo para uso industrial"*  (Only for industrial use).  
* **Professional/Consumer Uses:**  These require different PPE thresholds and exposure scenarios. You must explicitly state if a product is unfit for consumer applications.**Establishing Restrictions:**  Restrictions must be derived directly from the hazards identified in Section 2 (e.g., flammability or corrosivity). You must operate under the technical standard that  **any use not explicitly identified in this section is considered potentially unsafe.**  Forcing users to operate within these defined parameters ensures that the risk assessments conducted during formulation remain valid in the field.**4\. Subsection 1.3: Supplier Identification and Accountability**  Legal accountability hinges on the identification of the "Responsible Person" putting the substance into the market. Every SDS must provide a clear line of sight to the entity responsible for the safety data.**Mandatory Data Points (NOM-018-STPS-2015 and REACH):**  
* **Full Legal Entity Name:**  You must use the full, registered name of the company. Abbreviations (e.g., "SW" instead of "The Sherwin-Williams Company") are non-compliant.  
* **Physical Address:**  Provide the complete physical location. In global chains, clearly distinguish between the manufacturer and the local importer or distributor.  
* **Responsible Person’s Email:**  Under modern GHS and REACH standards, providing a dedicated email for the person responsible for the SDS is mandatory. This facilitates the rapid flow of safety information and the reporting of new hazards back through the supply chain.**5\. Subsection 1.4: Emergency Telephone Protocols**  Section 1.4 is the "last line of defense." When engineering controls and PPE fail, this number provides the only immediate link to toxicological and technical expertise.**Functional Requirements:**  
* **24/7 Availability:**  The service must be active and accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  
* **Linguistic Requirements:**  The responder must speak the official language of the country where the product is marketed.  
* **Service Verification:**  Audit whether the number is an internal company line or a third-party toxicological center.The source SDS for Epigrip C251 explicitly lists "Proveedor: No disponible" (Provider: Not available) in Section 1.4.  **This is a critical non-compliance.**  Under NOM-018-STPS-2015 and GHS, entering "Not Available" for a hazardous substance (especially one classified as R10-Flammable and R34-Corrosive) is an automatic failure of a regulatory audit and creates massive legal liability.| Best Practice: Emergency Number Documentation || \------ || **Mandate Functionality:**  You must verify the functionality of the emergency line before publication. "Not Available" or "N/A" is never an acceptable entry for hazardous chemicals. Ensure the number includes the international country code. |

**6\. Verification and Compliance Checklist**  A final audit of Section 1 is essential to prevent administrative fines and ensure the integrity of the workplace safety program.**Final Verification Checklist:**

*   **Signage Check:**  Does the product identifier match the workplace signage (NOM-018-STPS-2015)?  
*   **Label Match:**  Is the name identical to the physical container label?  
*   **CAS/EC Integrity:**  Are both CAS numbers and EC numbers (e.g., 202-859-9) present and verified?  
*   **Accountability:**  Is the supplier’s full legal name listed without abbreviations?  
*   **Emergency Readiness:**  Is the 24/7 emergency number active and documented? (Reject any SDS listing "No disponible").**Examples: Correct vs. Incorrect Formatting**| Element | Correct (Compliant) | Incorrect (Non-Compliant) || \------ | \------ | \------ || **Product Identifier** | Epigrip C251 Phenolic Epoxy Primer/Finish \- Additive (C251A) | Epoxy Paint Additive || **Chemical Codes** | CAS: 100-51-6; CE: 202-859-9 | Not listed / N/A || **Identified Uses** | Paint related material. Industrial use only. | General coatings. || **Supplier Info** | The Sherwin-Williams Company, 101 W.
